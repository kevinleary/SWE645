<!-- Need to add 

  1. CSS stylesheet fleshed out
  2. Text boxes for first name, last name, street address, city, state, zip, telephone number, e-mail, and
	date of survey, which are required fields. 
  3. Checkboxes that allow prospective students to indicate what they liked most about the campus. The
	checkboxes should include: students, location, campus, atmosphere, dorm rooms, and sports.
  4. Radio buttons that allow the prospective students to indicate how they became interested in the
	university. Options should include: friends, television, Internet, and other.
